# react-scripts

This package includes custom scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We added:
- eslint in webpack takes any custom config from .eslintrc. It only outputs errors, not warnings (quiet mode).

To make a starter app with create-react-app and this customised config, please run:

np create-react-app test-app --scripts-version ocasta-react-scripts

Please refer to its documentation:
